    "## State controllability\n",
    "The state of a deterministic system, which is the set of values of all the system's state variables (those variables characterized by dynamic equations), completely describes the system at any given time. In particular, no information on the past of a system is needed to help in predicting the future, if the states at the present time are known and all current and future values of the control variables (those whose values can be chosen) are known.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Complete state controllability (or simply controllability if no other context is given) \n",
    "describes the ability of an external input (the vector of control variables) to move the internal state of a system from any initial state to any other final state in a finite time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "By giving the external control input we can move the internal state of the system from any initial state to final state within in a finite time period.By measuring the full state feedback we can get back the full state space of the control system (We can keep the eignen values any where we want) then we can tell that the system is controllable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output controllability\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllability is the related notion for the output of the system (denoted y in the previous equations); the output controllability describes the ability of an external input to move the output from any initial condition to any final condition in a finite time interval. It is not necessary that there is any relationship between state controllability and output controllability. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case: By changing the value of K (gain) we should be able to change the eigen values of the closed loop system to our desired eigen values then we can tell that the system is controllable. <br/> <br/>\n",

    "# Pole placement method\n",
    "Full state feedback (FSF), or pole placement, is a method employed in feedback control system theory to place the closed-loop poles of a plant in pre-determined locations in the s-plane. Placing poles is desirable because the location of the poles corresponds directly to the eigenvalues of the system, which control the characteristics of the response of the system. The system must be considered controllable in order to implement this method.\n",
