    "This lecture is about the perspective of dynamical systems, sequence of ordinary differential equations in terms of the state of your system. This is been an extremely successful pheonomeon for modelling real world phenomenon.We model the fluid flow over a wing or the population dynamics in a city, or a spread of a discease or stock market, climate, planets moving around the solar system. All these can be modelled as dynamical system. This is a frame work to model to take in data from the real world and build models which we can use for prediction. Often we want to go beyond describing the system of interest, actually manipulate the system actively to change its behavior. That could be just imposing some controller or just setting inputs into the system in a certain pre-planned way to manipulate it or you can actuallt measure that system and make decisions based on how the system is responding to what you do. We can take an example of a dynamic system pendulam or a crane, you want to make more stable. We write down the system of equations and then we design some control policy that changes the behavior of the system to be more desirable."
